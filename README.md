2v2 Rocket League–inspired car-soccer simulation built as an Agent-Based Model (ABM) in NetLogo to compare archetype strategies.
# Rocket League–Inspired 2v2 Agent-Based Model (NetLogo)

This project is a minimal **2v2 car-soccer simulation** inspired by the video game *Rocket League*, implemented as an **Agent-Based Model (ABM)** in **NetLogo**.

The goal is to compare different **player archetypes** (tactical behaviours) and evaluate which strategies perform best in a competitive, sports-like environment.

---

## Key Features
- 2v2 match simulation: cars, ball, goals, walls, and boost resources
- Multiple archetypes with distinct decision-making (e.g., chasing, defending, rotating, disrupting)
- Environment perception + agent actions based on archetype rules
- Experimental framework for comparing team combinations and behaviours

---

## Tech Stack
- **NetLogo** (ABM simulation)

---

## How to Run
1. Install **NetLogo** (version used in coursework if applicable)
2. Open the model file:
   - `model/CourseworkP2855274.nlogox`
3. In the Interface tab, click:
   - **Setup**
   - **Go** (or **Go Forever**)

---

## Experiments
The model can be used to run repeated matches to compare:
- archetype vs archetype performance
- different 2v2 team compositions
- outcome metrics such as wins, goals, or other in-model performance indicators

(See the coursework report for experiment design and discussion.)
